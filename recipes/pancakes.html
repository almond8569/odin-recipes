    <p>Who wouldn't want to wake up to a stack of warm, fluffy pancakes drizzled with maple syrup? This is my go-to recipe for basic yet oh-so-delicious pancakes that never fail to satisfy!</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
       <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
       <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
       <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
       <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
       <li>2 cups buttermilk (or 2 cups milk mixed with 2 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar)</li>
       <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
       <li>2 large eggs</li>
       <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
       <li>1-2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
     </ul>

   <h3>Steps</h3>    
     <ol>
       <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. In second medium bowl, whisk buttermilk, sour cream, eggs, and melted butter together. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients; gently stir until just combined(batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Do not overmix. Let batter sit 10 minutes before cooking.</li>
       <li>Heat 1 teaspoon oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering.</li>
       <li>Using 1/4-cup dry measuring cup (or a trusty ladle), portion batter into pan in 4 places. Cook until edges are set, first side is goldren brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longers. Serve pancakes immediately. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining oil as necessary.</li> 
     </ol>
